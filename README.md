# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Background:
 You are part of a development team working on an AI-based Smart Health Assistant named "MediGuide" that
 assists elderly patients in managing chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. The assistant
 must provide tailored health advice, medication reminders, daily tips, and emotional support through natural
 language conversations.
 # Objective:
 Develop a scenario-based report that demonstrates how diverse prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot,
 chain-of-thought, role-based, and multi-modal prompts) can be used to optimize MediGuide’s responses in
 different use cases.
 # output:
 1. Zero-Shot Prompting Use Case: Patient asks for a tip to manage blood sugar levels. Prompt: "Give a tip to
 manage blood sugar levels for a diabetic elderly patient."
 Output: "To manage blood sugar, maintain a consistent meal schedule, avoid sugary snacks, and monitor
 glucose levels regularly."
 2. Few-Shot Prompting Use Case: Provide medication reminders and timing. Prompt: 
Output: "You should take your blood pressure medication in the morning, preferably after waking up, as
 advised by your healthcare provider."

 4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting Use Case: Guiding a patient to understand why daily walks are important.
 Prompt: "Why should I go for a walk daily? Explain step by step."
  Output: "Daily walking helps in many ways: It improves blood circulation. Regular activity helps in lowering
 blood sugar levels. It strengthens muscles and joints, beneficial for arthritis. Walking also improves mood and
 reduces stress."
 6. Role-Based Prompting Use Case: Emotional support and motivation. Prompt: "You are a compassionate
 health assistant helping an elderly patient who feels lonely. Provide emotional support."
 Output: "I understand you might feel lonely sometimes. You're not alone—many people feel this way. I'm here
 to talk to you, remind you how strong you are, and help you stay healthy. Would you like a motivational quote
 or a breathing exercise together?"
 7. Multi-Modal Prompting Use Case: Explain how to take insulin using image + text.
 Prompt: "Using the uploaded image of an insulin pen, explain how to use it safely."
 Output: "This is an insulin pen. Here's how to use it: Wash your hands. Remove the pen cap and attach a new
 needle. Prime the pen by pressing out a small amount. Dial your dose. Pinch your skin and inject at a 90
degree angle. Hold for 5-10 seconds, then remove and dispose safely.
# Result:
thus,the prompt for the above problem has been executed successfully
